Macrophages are fundamental cells of the innate immune system that support normal
haematopoiesis, fight infection and play roles in both anti-cancer immunity and tumour
progression. However, the function of macrophages in myeloid leukaemias remains
largely unknown due to difficulties in isolating non-transformed cells from those
derived from the malignant clone. Here we use a state-of-the-art chimeric mouse
model of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) to study the impact of the dysregulated
bone marrow (BM) microenvironment on bystander macrophages. Utilising both single
cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) negative
macrophages and secretory proteomics of murine c-Kit+ stem/progenitor cells we have
uncovered that macrophages exposed to a CML environment are altered
transcriptionally and have reduced phagocytic function. Comparison of CML exposed
macrophages to control counterparts by scRNA-seq has demonstrated significant
heterogeneity in bone marrow (BM) macrophages, with the CML niche driving two
unique subpopulations of immature and anti-inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore,
we have identified that CML exposed macrophages can be separated from their
normal counterparts via differential expression of surface markers CD36 and TGFBI,
thereby providing us with a novel strategy to isolate Ph- macrophages in a CML BM
niche. Finally, we have demonstrated that the dysregulated CML protein secretome is
partially responsible for the in vivo alterations of macrophages, uncovering aberrant
production of the immune modulatory protein lactotransferrin (LTF), and showing
exposure to CML secreted factors suppresses phagocytosis, mitochondrial respiration,
and inflammatory gene expression in BM macrophages.
